# bst-traversal


  Write three functions that take in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an empty
  array, traverse the BST, add its nodes' values to the input array, and return
  that array. The three functions should traverse the BST using the in-order,
  pre-order, and post-order tree-traversal techniques, respectively.
  If you're unfamiliar with tree-traversal techniques, we recommend watching the
  Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before
  starting to code. Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right
  child node. A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST
  property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its
  value  is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid
  BST nodes themselves or None / null.
